The History of Bitcoin
===============

"[The History of Bitcoin](http://paladini.github.io/bitcoin-history/)" allows users discover the history of Bitcoin in an animated and awesome timeline. This is just an "one day project" that every programmer have, but if you liked it feel free to [suggest improves](https://github.com/paladini/bitcoin-history/issues), [fork](https://github.com/paladini/bitcoin-history/fork) or [star it](https://github.com/paladini/bitcoin-history/star).

Oh, I almost forget. If you have blog, post about our website, so someone can have a nice idea based on this concept (I hope so) or just make a copy of it talking about [Dogecoin](http://dogecoin.com/) instead BTC.

Oh my...fuck!
-------------
Today I discover that "[Bitcoin History](http://historyofbitcoin.org/)" exists and use the same concept I choose to this project. They have a nice website with a great timeline, they're great - but fuck this shit, we're open-source bitch! \o/

Currently, we doesn't appear in any place. Wow, much work, such deception.

About
------------

"The History of Bitcoin" was created by [Fernando Paladini](https://github.com/paladini) in less then one day, one of their "one day projects" (well...actually this is the first). I used the incredible [Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) to create the embeded timeline. You can found our docs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AhVWQDj56wqrdGhGU1FmUlJBblA1RG9WOE1xYl9GaXc&output=html).
